            <h2 id="welcome">Welcome on TerrariaBot documentation</h2>
            TerrariaBot is a project that have for aim to let people easily create bot in C# for the game Terraria.<br/>
            This project is still in an early stage of development.<br/>
            <br/>
            You can access the GitHub page here: <a href="https://github.com/Xwilarg/TerrariaBot">https://github.com/Xwilarg/TerrariaBot</a><br/>
            And on NuGet here: <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/TerrariaBot/">https://www.nuget.org/packages/TerrariaBot/</a><br/>
            If you need additional help you can come ask your questions on <a href="https://discord.gg/H6wMRYV">Discord</a> or open an issue on <a href="https://github.com/Xwilarg/TerrariaBot/issues">GitHub</a><br/>

            <h2 id="quickStart">Quick Start</h2>
            To begin with instantiate a new IPClient, no parameter are needed
            <pre class="prettyprint">
IPClient client = new IPClient();</pre>
            Once this is done, you can prepare all your callbacks (see section below).
            Then just connect to the server using
            <pre class="prettyprint">
client.ConnectWithIP(string ip, PlayerInformation playerInfos, string serverPassword = "");</pre>
            The first argument is the IP of your server and the second the information about the appearance of your bot.<br/>
            If your server need a password you can write at as the optional 3rd argument of the ConnectWithIP function.<br/>
            When you are done with that, see the sections below for more information on how to interact with the library.<br/>
            <br/>
            <hr/>
            <h2 id="usingSteam">Connecting with Steam instead of direct IP</h2>
            The bot can also connect using your Steam account instead of a direct IP.<br/>
            For that you'll need 2 dependencies:<br/>
            <ul>
                <li>TerrariaBot.Steam (NuGet package not available yet)</li>
                <li>Steamworks.NET, you can find the latest release <a href="https://github.com/rlabrecque/Steamworks.NET/releases">here</a></li>
            </ul>
            You'll also need to add steam_api64.dll and Steamworks.NET.dll next to your executable.<br/>
            Instead of instantiating with a IPClient and using ConnectWithIP you need to use a SteamClient and connect with ConnectWithSteamId.<br/>
            <pre class="prettyprint">
client.ConnectWithIP(ulong friendSteamId, PlayerInformation playerInfos, string serverPassword = "");</pre>
            The first argument is your friend Steam ID (he must be in your friend list), the others ones are the same as ConnectWithIP.
            <br/>
            <hr/>
            <h2 id="playerInformation">PlayerInformation</h2>
            PlayerInformation is a struct allowing to define how your character will be when connecting.
            <pre class="prettyprint">
public PlayerInformation(string name, byte hairVariant, Color hairColor, Color skinColor, Color eyesColor, Color shirtColor, Color underShirtColor, Color pantsColor, Color shoesColor, PlayerDifficulty difficulty)</pre>
            The arguments are your name, your hair style, all the colors of your clothes and the difficulty you're player will be in.<br/>
            A Color is a struct that take the red, green and blue color in it constructor.<br/>
            If you don't want to bother with all of that you can use the static function GetRandomPlayer
            <pre class="prettyprint">
public static PlayerInformation GetRandomPlayer(string name, PlayerDifficulty difficulty)</pre>
            This will take a random value for all colors, you then just need to give a name and difficulty.<br/>
            When you spawn, your base health will be 100 and base mana will be 20.<br/>
            You can change that using
            <pre class="prettyprint">
public void SetHealth(short value)</pre>
            And
            <pre class="prettyprint">
public void SetMana(short value)</pre>
            You just need to give them the new value you want and it'll change your player base health/mana.<br/>
            <br/>
            <hr/>
            <h2 id="clientEvents">Client events</h2>

            Log fires an event when any message is sent from the library. The first argument is used to tell if the message is a debug message, information, warning or error.

public event Action<LogLevel, string> Log;</pre>
            <br/>
